Hi, I'm Patrick. I make things.

- 2D & 3D art
- Games & Experiences
- Software & Websites (like this one)

I'm interested how imagination can be put in the service of universal flourishing and the elimination of want and fear. And also, cartoons!

I made this website ([source code](https://github.com/patreeceeo/patreeceeo.github.io)) using [Astro](https://astro.build), an "islands architecture" framework. It's hosted on GitHub Pages.

You may contact me at pscale01 at Gmail dot com.
