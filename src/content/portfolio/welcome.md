Hi, I'm Patrick. I'm interested in creativity and creative uses of software and creating software and software that can be used to create other things, including software!

I believe in the ethos and spirit of the World Wide Web: multilaterally advancing technology for the common good.

I pursue radical and perhaps unattainable ends. Maybe you can get a sense of what I'm about by clicking around. Regardless, I hope you enjoy your stay!
