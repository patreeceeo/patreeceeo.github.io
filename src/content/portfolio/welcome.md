Hi, I'm Patrick. I'm interested in creativity. Specifically, creative uses of technology. [Web technology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.14791), to be specific. To be even more specific, I believe that WebGL, [WebGPU](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/unity-sees-webgpu-is-a-growing-market-for-game-development), Web&lt;Whatever&gt;s offer exciting [opportunities](https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/5939597/browser-games-market-report) for developers (and players!) of games and interactive digital media. I think about this an unhealthy amount.

Also, I:
- have a [background in Software Engineering](/resume.pdf) and a degree in Computer Science.
- draw [comix and make 2D & 3D art](/#art)!
- am interested in games that are enriching, perhaps even educational, and also fun.
- pursue some things that might be unattainable. To only go after what can easily be had, what a dull existence!
- made this website ([source code](https://github.com/patreeceeo/patreeceeo.github.io)) using [Astro](https://astro.build), an "islands architecture" framework. It's hosted on GitHub Pages.

Thanks for stopping by, I hope you enjoy your visit!
