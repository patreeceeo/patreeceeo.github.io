Hi, I'm Patrick. I'm interested in creativity. Specifically, creative uses of technology. Web technology, to be specific. To be even more specific, I believe that WebGL, WebGPU, Web&lt;Whatever&gt;s offer exciting opportunities for developers (and players!) of games and interactive digital media. I think about this an unhealthy amount.

Also, I draw comix and make 2D & 3D art!

I made this website ([source code](https://github.com/patreeceeo/patreeceeo.github.io)) using [Astro](https://astro.build), an "islands architecture" framework. It's hosted on GitHub Pages.

You may contact me at pscale01 at Gmail dot com.

Thanks for stopping by, I hope you enjoy your visit!
