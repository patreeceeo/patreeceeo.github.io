 This is portfolio site developed using Astro.

Currently all of the content is on the index page with links on the side to navigation between sections.

I'd like to extend this so that there's also a "blog" link that leads to another index page. This page should be a like a blog index page with titles that link to pages that show the full entry.

The content for the blog should come from src/content/blog.

All of these pages should have the same layout.
